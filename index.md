I am a graduate student in an MS program in the Graudate School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI) at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/), South Korea.
My primary research interest is in low-level vison. I am also interested in video understanding using Large Language Model (LLM).
I am a member of the [computer vision lab.](https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) in POSTECH, under supervision of Professor [Minsu Cho](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/~mcho/).
